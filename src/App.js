Put any content you want in the modal,
ensure it is dismissable or closable,
include comments to help us understand

should also be WCAG 2.1 AA Compliant

NB: Getting the task done is more important than
it being complete, don't worry about impelementing 
the solution in a single file

Feel free to add libraries on the left,
